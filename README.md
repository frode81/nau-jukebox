NAU JUKEBOX
===========
This is a fun, side project to allow our team to collectively suggest and play a continuously pending list of songs.

The songs URL is currently parsable from nhaccuatui.com, mp3.zing.com, soundcloud.com, youtube.com

**NOTE: This code is under major migration to support OAuth login and multi-room. Stay tuned.**
